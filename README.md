A pre/post processing toolbox for the VIC model

Truely a work in progress

This is a library of python scripts to go along with the pre/post 
processing of VIC model forcings/parameters/outputs.

Right now this is just a collection of a few scripts but as the toolbox grows, 
a more formal structure may be put together.
