VICpy
=====

A pre/post processing toolbox for the VIC model (https://github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC)

Truely a work in progress...

This is a library of python scripts to go along with the pre/post 
processing of VIC model forcings/parameters/outputs.

Right now this is just a collection of a few scripts but as the toolbox grows, 
a more formal structure may be put together.  

Questions? Sure, Joe Hamman - jhamman@hydro.washington.edu
